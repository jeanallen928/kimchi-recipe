김치찜 만드는 방법 merge conflict
1. Slice the large onion thinly and place it in the bottom of a heavy pot.
2. Place 2 to 3 large and long leaves on the cutting board and add 1 strip of pork belly in the center lengthwise. Grab the kimchi and pork belly and roll them up tightly. Tuck the sides in and shape the roll tightly so that it won’t fall apart while cooking.
3. Put the roll on the sliced onion in the pot. Repeat to make 4 more rolls with the rest of pork strips and kimchi. Put them into the pot.
4. Spread the hot pepper paste on the top of each roll evenly with a wooden spoon. Drizzle the rice syrup and 2 teaspoons toasted sesame oil over top. Sprinkle with¼ teaspoon of ground black pepper. Add 1 cup water.
5. Cover and cook for 10 minutes over medium high heat. Lower the heat to medium and cook for another 30 minutes.
6. Open and ladle some broth from the bottom of the pot over top of the rolls so that the seasonings mix evenly.  Cover and cook another 20 minutes.  Total cooking time will be 1 hour.
7. Serve hot with white fluffy rice or multigrain rice. You can give each diner their own roll, or cut them up into bite sized pieces for them.
