김치수제비 만드는 법
Make the soup:
1. Put the cleaned anchovies into a soup pouch and seal it tightly, or wrap them in a cheese cloth, all tied up.
2. In a large pot, combine the water, anchovy pouch, kimchi, kimchi brine, onion, and garlic. Cook for 25 minutes over medium high until the kimchi turns a little soft and the broth is nicely infused with the anchovy flavor. If the soup starts to boil over, crack the lid a bit.
3. Take out the anchovy pouch and discard.
4. Add the fish sauce (or salt to your taste).  Taste the broth and add more fish sauce or salt if you think it needs it. Remove from the heat.
Make the noodles and serve:
1. Uncover the soup and bring it back to a boil.
2. 감자수제비를 넣는다.
3. Stir the noodle soup with a ladle or wooden spoon. Add the gochujang, green onions, cover, and cook for 5 minutes over medium-high heat (crack the lid if necessary to prevent the soup from boiling over), until all the noodles are floating and cooked through.
4. Remove from the heat and stir in the toasted sesame oil (if used). Ladle the soup into individual bowls and serve right away  with  side  dishes.
